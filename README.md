# hxsuite
Haxe library for cross-language automation tasks for running, aggregation and reporting

### STATUS
Project is started for doing my personal research benchmarks for almost all current haxe platforms.
Project is not developed actively. I'm going to continue development in future. Also it depends on `hxmake` development status.

### PLAN
- Plugin for `hxmake`
- Move current benchmarks to examples
- Make indepentent API for running
- Unit-test tasks
